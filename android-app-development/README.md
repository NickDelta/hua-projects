# 2 Android Apps
These are the 2 apps I made for the Android Development course of my university. I'm not an Android Developer so I don't know if you should exemplify from them for your projects.

## The Apps
- `user-tracker` is an Android app that stores location info of multiple users into an SQLite database and then retrieves them back on request.

- `location-tracker` is an Android app that stores the user's location history by using the phone's GPS sensor. The service is automatically activated every time the AC charger is disconnected.
